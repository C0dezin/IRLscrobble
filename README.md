# IRLscrobble
_Inspired by [LastFm Unplugged](https://blog.last.fm/2013/04/01/announcing-lastfm-unplugged)_

Imagine that you go to a concert, or listen to music somewhere where you don't have direct access to the internet and you want to save everything you heard at the right time.

If you have already experienced or thought about this, this program is your possible solution!

This small script can import .csv files into your last.fm.

CSV files are comma separated value files(think of excel for example)

Example:

`alex g,Track7,c-sides,2024-5-2,12:29:23`

Adding this to your csv file and running the code, your scrobble would be counted on the exact day and time written

So, it would show like this

You can write .csv files on your cellphone or even a piece of paper(you will need to rewrite digitally)!
